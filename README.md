This project aims to build a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a majority of transactions being legitimate. To handle the imbalance, we use downsampling techniques to create a balanced dataset for training.

Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to prevent financial losses. This project uses machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, we use downsampling to balance the classes before training the model.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
